# Learnings for solving YDKJS Getting Started Exercices
## Comparison Practice
I solved this by turning everything into Date objects. This avoided using comparisons basically, but when talking about time, using Date makes sense to me since it has already implemented the required logic. Looking at the suggested solution, I see that the author is using regexp and has implemented the logic of hours and seconds manually. This is both more verbose and less readable to me, and is reinventing the wheel IMO.

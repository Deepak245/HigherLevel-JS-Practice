# Project Doggos Picture Viewer

This is a simple picture viewer for viewing pictures of dogs using [DOG CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)

## Goals
1. Learn to use fetch() using an open API.
2. Learn to use Parcel as a bundler. 
3. Implement Dark Mode using CSS Custom Properties as described [here](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/)

## Further Improvements
* Find a way to remove the picture-card background when the image has loaded (perhaps using Promise.finally() ? )
